As such it requires painstaking effort to trace the movement of funds from the source where they are taken to the assets into which they have been converted.</p><p>However with the aid of technology and forensic experts carrying out audit trails and working hand in hand with law enforcement agencies, the tracking and tracing of such funds can be done across different countries and jurisdictions. This type of work has become quite important and much sought after particularly in the context of the growth of anti money laundering legislation and regulations across the world.</p><p>Tracing stolen assets by itself would however be incomplete without the means to recover the assets once their location has been identified. Thus it is usually necessary to apply for injunctions to freeze the assets or the bank accounts containing the illicit funds to prevent their dissipation, and then recover and restore them to their lawful owners through legal proceedings. This is another area where our firm can offer its specialist service in drawing upon its extensive knowledge and skills to provide an efficient and time critical service.  </p></div><div class="col-0"><div class="pic"></div></div></div></div></section>
