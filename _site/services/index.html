    <section id="s1" class="service-1"><div class="container flex flex--center"><div class="col-5 flex flex--center"><div class="col-22"><h2>ASSET TRACING & RECOVERY</h2><p>Assets such as property shares and cash representing the proceeds of crime and corruption are usually hidden under the cover of shell companies with nominee directors, offshore companies and corporate bank accounts to disguise the true ownership of the assets. As such it requires painstaking effort to trace the movement of funds from the source where they are taken to the assets into which they have been converted.</p><p>However with the aid of technology and forensic experts carrying out audit trails and working hand in hand with law enforcement agencies, the tracking and tracing of such funds can be done across different countries and jurisdictions. This type of work has become quite important and much sought after particularly in the context of the growth of anti money laundering legislation and regulations across the world.</p><p>Tracing stolen assets by itself would however be incomplete without the means to recover the assets once their location has been identified. Thus it is usually necessary to apply for injunctions to freeze the assets or the bank accounts containing the illicit funds to prevent their dissipation, and then recover and restore them to their lawful owners through legal proceedings. This is another area where our firm can offer its specialist service in drawing upon its extensive knowledge and skills to provide an efficient and time critical service.  </p></div><div class="col-0"><div class="pic"></div></div></div></div></section>
    <section id="s2" class="service-2"><div class="container flex flex--center"><div class="col-5 flex flex--center"><div class="col-22"><h2>DRAFTING & ADVISING ON CROSS BORDER COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS</h2><p>Cross Border Commercial Agreements are essentially commercial agreements between parties in different countries.   </p><p>These  agreements in addition to setting out the legal rights and duties of the parties in a commercial context also have to deal with and resolve any conflict between the different laws and regulations in the countries in which the parties are based.    </p><p>Most  International  Commercial agreements have overcome this obstacle by making provision for any dispute arising from the agreement to be governed by English law.   </p><p>As English lawyers we are ideally placed to draft such agreements while at the same time having the expertise to advise on potential conflicts and disputes that could arise from them.   The parties can therefore enter into the agreements with the  peace of mind  and confidence that they will be getting a comprehensive legal service which has taken account of not just the present but the future.</p></div><div class="col-0 order-first"><div class="pic"></div></div></div></div></section>

    <section id="s4" class="service-4"><div class="container flex flex--center"><div class="col-5 flex flex--center"><div class="col-22"><h2>DUE DILLIGENCE ON SUB-SAHARAN FRONTIER MARKETS</h2><p>The frontier markets of Sub Saharan Africa and in particular the economies and financial markets of  Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast, are growing  by leaps and bounds and are beginning to attract investment and private equity funds from the West.  </p><p>These markets however have a reputation for being risky and lacking in transparency which has made a large number of potential investors wary of investing in them.
